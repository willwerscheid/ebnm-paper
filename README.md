# ebnm-paper

To reproduce results and figures, run code by following the instructions in the `code` folder.

The `output` folder includes `.rds` results from one run of the code for both the main paper and the appendix. The `figs` folder includes figures for the paper, which were generated from the same runs.

We additionally include results from one "full" run of the timing study as `output/timecomps_full.rds` (see `code/README.md` for details).
